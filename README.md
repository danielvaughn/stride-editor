## Stride

The Stride Editor is a side project that I'm currently working on,
which takes inspiration from several ideas I've developed while working on Matry.
At its heart, it can be described as "vim for UI designers."
It's a keyboard-driven UI design tool that is intended to bridge the gap between designers and developers.

You can [view a demo here](https://stride-editor.vercel.app). WARNING - this tool is actively being developed, meaning you should expect bugs and breaking changes.

## Design principles

Stride is governed by a few key principles:

1. **Efficiency begets power**. The primary motto of a professional tool should be to empower you, and most of the time that means *getting out of your way*.
2. **Power over familiarity**. Professional tools shouldn't be afraid to depart dramatically from long-standing conventions, if doing so empowers their users.
3. **Design should be performed in the target medium**. If you're designing for the web, then the browser should be your working environment.
4. **Drawing tools are not equipped to solve modern design problems**. At scale, designing a product often means creating a system, and text is better suited for that purpose than graphical illustrations.
5. **Designers and developers should collaborate on the same artifact**. In the game industry, artists and developers actively collaborate together on the final product, yet for web and mobile app development, this has never been the case. Why shouldn't it be?
