icons are such a common use case for app development that it makes sense to have specialized,
built-in functionality to support it.
what should the extension look like?

a user should be able to...
- easily remember what command to use to search for icons
- browse icon families
- browse icons within a family
- browse icons across all families
- search for families
- search for icons within a family
- search for icons across all families

while all these are useful, we could probably deploy with a subset of features:
- browse icons across all families
- search for icons across all families
